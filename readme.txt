I have been using git, can get code from here https://github.com/samf23/discussion_app

Instructions to use are on home page(click button)

More detailed instructions:

1)To use the site you have to be logged in. So create an account. Discussion topics should appear at the top in the nav once signed up or logged in with existing account. The login I have been using is email: sam@gmail.com password: password in case you can't sign in

2)Click on discussion topics and choose one of the topics. you will go to a new page with a table of all the discussions for that topic. On this page you can create a new discussion, you can view a discussion(click on discussion title in the table) and if you are the user that created that discussion you will be able to edit or delete, if you are not the user that created it you won't have the options to edit or delete.

3)Click on the title of the discussion in the table, you will go to a new page showing the discussion and its comments. Here you can create a comment. The user will be able to edit or delete their own comments but not other user comments
